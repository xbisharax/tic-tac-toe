# tic-tac-toe
purpose: 

    A Java program that will allow two users to play tic, tac, toe with a
    3x3 board. The two players should be able to alternatively enter their
    X or O. A player should not be able to place their X or O on a spot already
    taken on the board.

    The program will check for a winner and continue if there isn't a winner. A
    player wins when they get three symbols in a row in one of three directions:
    horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

    The program will display the winner when one is found or display that it was
    a draw once all the boxes on the board have been filled.

    The program should allow the users to keep playing against each other until
    they are ready to quit. When they quit, the program should tell the users how
    many games each player won as well as how many ties there were.
